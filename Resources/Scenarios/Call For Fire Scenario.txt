You are a Platoon Leader (PL) in support of Company operations overseas. The general friendly situation is that other companies in your battalion are also operating in the area of operations (AO) and your battalion is providing artillery and limited attack helicopter support as required. There are civilian populations in your AO that have been displaced due to a natural disaster, and they are moving through the area to non-government organization (NGO; e.g., the Red Cross) camps. The general enemy situation is that there are decentralized insurgents working in small teams within the AO using small arms, medium crew served weapons and mortars. Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) will be on station for the next two hours.

Your mission is to set up a blocking position on a large intersection to allow freedom of movement for the influx of large, displaced populations currently moving into your part of the AO. As the mission unfolds, you receive reports of a possible mortar team in close proximity to your platoonâ€™s blocking position. A member of your unit observes personnel on a ridgeline in the general direction of the suspected mortar team and thinks they may be enemy combatants. ISR assets can also see the suspected mortar team but cannot positively identify them.

You report the situation to your Company Commander, who reminds you that your priorities include getting PID before engaging, maintaining your blocking position without sacrificing force protection, and ensuring safety of the civilians moving through your AO. Your Commander then states that battalion assets are standing by as needed.
