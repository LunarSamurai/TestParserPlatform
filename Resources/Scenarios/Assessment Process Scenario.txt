You are a Platoon Leader (PL). Currently, your Company's mission is to secure the area around a busy market in a village located close to your Forward Operative Base (FOB). Specifically, your platoon has been tasked to assess and secure a small compound that is located next to the market area. With little distance from multiple shops and vendors. There are concerns about vulnerabiltiies even though there have been no known insurgents in the immediate area of operations (AO). 
The CO CDR asks you and your Platoon Sergeant (PSG) to teach your platoon a process that they can use now and in the future for how to conduct a good assessment to inform security enhancements. As the PSG starts to take the platoon through the assessment process they've used in the past, it's clear that some members of the team do not understand. One of your most capable Squad Leaders (SL) starts practicing the process but keeps reverting to another approache they have successfully used in the past rather than the one being taught.
You know that you must maintain good relationships with your NCO's and consider their perspectives, while balancing the potentialneed to adjust the apporach and work within the commander's intnet to secure the compound.
